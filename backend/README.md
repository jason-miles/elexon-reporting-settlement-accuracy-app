# Backend

Shared Python utilities and helpers for Databricks jobs and the app:

- **data_access.py** – Query Unity Catalog tables, warehouse connection helpers.
- **auth_helpers.py** – Purpose-based access checks, group/role helpers (for app narrative).
- **policy_explanation.py** – Human-readable explanations of governance policies.

Used by notebooks and (if applicable) by app backend endpoints.
